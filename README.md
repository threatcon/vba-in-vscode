## Why?

I build and maintain VBA applications in Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Visio. The Visual Basic Editor has not seen any enhancements in forever, the popular third-party add-ins as awesome as they are, are walled gardens. If you can think about it, someone has created an extension for it, and if not, you can find something close, fork it and customize it to fit what you need. I also work in other languages and having to switch editors and workflows is very annoying.

## How?

Well that is the interesting part. If you scower the web, you will find countless tools to extract VBA modules out of Excel. There are VS Code extensions that have syntax, snippets and other quality of life enhancements. You just have to find them and be willing to tinker with them until you can get the to work as close as they would for their intended language.
